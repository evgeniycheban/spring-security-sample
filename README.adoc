Your are likely viewing this because you have submitted a forum question or a JIRA and this is a sample project to illustrate points made in my response.
You can either run this from the commandline or an IDE that supports Maven (i.e. Spring Tool Suite).

== Running from the commandline

To run the sample application you must have Java installed and on your path.
After doing so you can easily run the application using the Spring Boot plugin.
Specifically:

* Navigate to the folder on the commandline
* To Start the application Linux based users use

+

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

+

Windows users use

+

[source,bat]
----
.\mvnw.bat spring-boot:run
----

Open another terminal:

[source,bash]
----
# Get a token with the username user and password of password
export TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/token -u user:password)
# Use the token to get a message
curl http://localhost:8080 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
